# ATLAS — Adaptive Tail Loss Analysis System

This repository contains the implementation of ATLAS, a hybrid tail-risk model designed to better capture extreme financial losses ("Black Swan" events).

Baseline risk models (Normal, Student-t, and EVT-GPD) are implemented for comparison.

The project focuses on Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and crisis-period backtesting.

Data sources: publicly available market index data.
